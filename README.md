# hand_ai
### A program which can be implemented in online classes, to detect when a student is raising their hand.

This AI model was made in https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ and then it was exported
into a .h5 file and then using [CV2](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) it takes a photo
using your webcam. It saves it and then analyses it, prints what it thinks it is and deletes the photo.

1. ## Training Data

   If you're changing the training data using Teachable machine, don't remove my data 
   just add your own on top of it.

2. ## Pull Requests

   If you are starting a pull request, make sure everything works and there are no errors,
   As for the model let it stay in the h5 format instead of a TensorFlow SavedModel type.
   And then I will review it. 👍
